# tanks_q3

Tanks is an interactive multi-player desktop game that is played by navigating your tank around a screen via keyboard controls. The user will choose their tank color upon starting the game. The goal of the game is to shoot the other players with your tank, therefore killing them. The user will be able to rotate their tank in any direction, create a bullet, and shoot that bullet. 

Our UFE will be Phaser and the use of web sockets.
